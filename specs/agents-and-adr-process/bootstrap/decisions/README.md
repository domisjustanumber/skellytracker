# Decision log

This log records the technical decisions of {{PROJECT}}, with their reasons and evidence. Read this
file and [open-work.md](open-work.md) before you change {{AREAS}} or the agent instructions. Then read
the Active entries that apply to your task. Then you do not repeat a settled question or a completed
measurement. Read a Proposed entry only for work in its section, or when a skill tells you to. Read
an entry of [historical.md](historical.md) only to find the reason for a decision
([ADR-0001](entries/0001-decision-log-agents-md-and-private-data.md)).

Each entry gives the decision, its reason, the evidence (when there is evidence), the alternatives
rejected and a "Not repeated" section for pitfalls already found. When a decision changes, add a new
entry that supersedes the old entry in full. A change of the text under a heading that an entry
links does not supersede that entry. The body of a decided entry changes only by the edits
that the [Rules](#rules) allow. To write an entry, use [template.md](template.md).

## Index

### Active

These entries are `accepted` or `evidence`.

| # | Decision | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| [0001](entries/0001-decision-log-agents-md-and-private-data.md) | Decision log and its rules; `AGENTS.md` files hold the instructions; `plans/` is local; no private data | accepted |

### Proposed

These entries wait for a decision of the user. Section is the section or area of the change, or
`none`.

| # | Decision | Section | Status |
|---|----------|---------|--------|

The entries that are `rejected`, `superseded by XXXX`, `absorbed into <path>#<anchor>`,
`evidence; used by XXXX` or `done` are in [historical.md](historical.md).

## Open work

The open work is in [open-work.md](open-work.md).

## Rules

- The body of an entry that is not `proposed` changes only by four edits: a link or anchor repair, a
  typo that does not change the meaning, the redaction of private data, and a change of ID with the
  repair of its citations. Each edit adds `_Edited YYYY-MM-DD (#PR): <kind>._` at the end of the
  entry, for example `re-ID from XXXX`. For a
  change of ID, the renamed entry gets `re-ID from XXXX`, and each repaired entry gets
  `citation repair`. Add these two lines only to an entry that is on `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}`.
- An absorb document is one of these: the root or a nested `AGENTS.md`, the skills, {{NORMATIVE_DOCS, for example the spec or the
  contract files}}, the Rules of this file with [template.md](template.md), and the docstring of a
  tool in `tools/` for the rules that it checks. An accepted entry is absorbed when one absorb
  document states all of its rules.
- The entry that supersedes an old entry restates each rule of the old entry that stays. A link can
  restate a rule. The link must go to a heading of an absorb document, and that heading must state
  the rule. The commit that changes the text under such a heading cites its own entry next to the
  changed rule.
- Only these status changes are allowed: `proposed` to `accepted` or `rejected`; `accepted` to
  `superseded by XXXX`, `absorbed into <path>#<anchor>` or `done`; `absorbed into <path>#<anchor>`
  to `superseded by XXXX`; and `evidence` to
  `evidence; used by XXXX`, when an accepted entry cites the `evidence` entry for its decision.
  `done` is for an accepted entry that records a one-off action, with no rule that stays, when the
  action is complete. Each status change adds its date and the PR that made it. In the same PR,
  change the status in the index and move the row to the table for the new status.
- `tools/check_decision_log.py` checks the tables, the status forms, the Section cell, the ID
  alphabet and the size limits. Its docstring states them. `tools/check_links.py` checks the links
  and the full-SHA permalinks. A tool is the source of a rule that it checks.
- A consolidation entry states the rules that stay from a group of entries, and it supersedes each
  entry of the group. It changes no decision. Write one when the read-path limit fails.
- Delete an open-work item when the work is done. Put a dated fact in `open-work.md` or in an
  entry, not in `AGENTS.md`.
- Put long evidence in a tracked file next to the entry, and link to it. A PR that raises a limit
  of `tools/check_decision_log.py` must add an entry.
- An ID changes only on a `re-ID:` line of `tools/check_decision_log.py`, to the ID of a new `--new`
  run.
- Until a commit is on `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}`, cite its PR number and the file path, not its SHA.
  The `ADR-` prefix is for citations only: a file name, a
  heading, an index row and a status line hold the bare ID. Cite a provisional entry of another repo
  by the repo name, the PR number and the slug. Do not edit a decided entry only to add or move the
  prefix or the link.

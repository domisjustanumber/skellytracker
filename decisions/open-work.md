# Open work

This file holds the open work of the [decision log](README.md): the repository state. The
implementation-stage work is in the
[implementation plan](../specs/sidecar-implementation-plan.md). The spec defects are in the open work of the
[spec log](../specs/model-sidecar/decisions/open-work.md#spec-defects). Read the items that apply to
your task.

## Implementation stage

The implementation-stage work is in the stages of phase 1 and phase 2 of the
[implementation plan](../specs/sidecar-implementation-plan.md) ([ADR-5WKW](entries/5WKW-implementation-work-in-the-plan.md);
[ADR-NHM3](entries/NHM3-phases-to-the-exporter-checkpoint.md)).

## Repository state

- **Dependency pins for the exporters.** [ADR-M2C6](entries/M2C6-exact-pins-and-one-python-patch-release.md)
  decides exact pins, `onnxruntime` 1.31 as a base dependency with GPU EPs as CUDA 13 plugin packs,
  and `requires-python = "==3.13.18"`. The exporters that agents build again pin the 2.0.0
  pre-release (the draft exporter guide). On 2026-10-28, two exporters required Python 3.14 or later,
  and uv could not resolve skellytracker in three of the four exporters. The OpenCV package
  (`opencv-contrib-python` or a headless package) is not decided. The dependency stage of the
  implementation plan writes the pins. Until then, an exporter runs the batch tool in the checkout
  environment.
- **Exporter open items.** At the 2.0.0 pre-release, remove the rows of
  `specs/draft/exporter-guide/sidecars/known-open-items.md` that name a reference implementation.
  They do not apply to a new exporter, and the skill `implement-sidecar-section` uses them until
  then ([x64y](entries/x64y-draft-exporter-guide-folder.md), item 6;
  [ADR-6J8E](entries/6J8E-exporters-run-released-skellytracker.md) item 1).
- The exporters are re-implemented against the current exporter guide. This file does not track the
  old exporter copies or paths.
- **Draft exporter guide.** `specs/draft/exporter-guide/` is not complete. A local plan of the user
  owns its creation. When the guide is complete, or when an end-to-end test proves that its first
  version works, a new entry moves it to `specs/exporter-guide/`
  ([x64y](entries/x64y-draft-exporter-guide-folder.md)). Each new part of the guide goes in a new
  folder beside `sidecars/`.
- **Exporter coverage note.** Retire `notes/sidecar-exporter-coverage.md` at the end of the
  spec-build stage. First, copy its unique measurements to an evidence entry
  ([ADR-5WKW](entries/5WKW-implementation-work-in-the-plan.md)).
- **Drift and vector-hash noise.** Two tool changes of `tools/intake_bundle.py` are later work
  ([ADR-FM0B](entries/FM0B-one-response-for-each-commit-group.md)). A section fingerprint for the
  drift finding: the section body without its front matter and without the text under
  "Implementer guidance" and "Authoring guidance". Do not reuse the changelog fingerprint: it does
  not hash the Behaviour text. A `vectors_sha256` of the parsed cases without `verified_against` and
  `unverified`, which `fill` prints and writes
  ([ADR-8DSW](entries/8DSW-vector-files-are-the-case-source.md)). An excused drift finding still
  blocks the session run of `batch` ([ADR-AD33](entries/AD33-bundles-are-untrusted-input.md)
  item 4). The user decides if a new entry changes that gate.
- **Kit PR in freemocap/project.** The kit is on the branch `dom/agents-and-adr-kit` of
  freemocap/project, in a PR for its owner
  ([ADR-P3NK](entries/P3NK-bootstrap-kit-in-freemocap-project.md)). The link repairs in 0031, NB91,
  QPS7 and Z05A pin the commit `0d88941` of that branch. When the PR merges with a different SHA,
  pin the merged commit.
